Cart: 4 items @ $5.00 each
Result:
- Regular Items: 4 × $5.00 = $20.00
- Free Items: 2 × $5.00 = $10.00 (saved as separate order items)
- Discount: $10.00
- Tax: 10% of ($20.00 - $10.00) = $1.00
- Total: $11.00
```

#### Percentage Discount:
```javascript
// Example: 20% Off
Cart: $100.00
Result:
- Subtotal: $100.00
- Discount: $20.00
- Tax: 10% of $80.00 = $8.00
- Total: $88.00
```

#### Fixed Amount Discount:
```javascript
// Example: $10 Off
Cart: $50.00
Result:
- Subtotal: $50.00
- Discount: $10.00
- Tax: 10% of $40.00 = $4.00
- Total: $44.00
```
