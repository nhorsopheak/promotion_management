## 🔄 How Promotions Work

### 1. Configuration
```php
// Promotion setup via admin panel
[
    'buy_quantity' => 2,
    'get_quantity' => 1,
    'apply_to_cheapest' => true,
    'eligible_category_ids' => [2], // Clothing category
]
```

### 2. Cart Processing
```php
$cartService = app(CartService::class);
$cartService->addItem($product, 1);
$cart = $cartService->getCartWithPromotions(); // Auto-applies promotions
```

### 3. Strategy Pattern
```php
class BuyXGetYFreeStrategy implements PromotionStrategyInterface
{
    public function apply(Collection $cartItems, Promotion $promotion, ?User $user): PromotionResult
    {
        // Complex promotion logic here
        return new PromotionResult($promotion, true, $discountAmount, $affectedItems);
    }
}
```
