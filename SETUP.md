# â””â”€â”€ Total: $129.98
#
# Applied Promotions:
# â”œâ”€â”€ Buy 2 Get 1 Free - Clothing
# â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Buy 2 clothing items, get 1 free
# â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Saved: $19.99
#
# âœ… Sample order created successfully!
# Order #ORD-20241205-001
# Total: $129.98
# Saved: $19.99
```

$tshirt = Product::where('sku', 'CLO-001')->first();
$jeans = Product::where('sku', 'CLO-002')->first();
$sneakers = Product::where('sku', 'CLO-003')->first();

$cartService->addItem($tshirt, 1);
$cartService->addItem($jeans, 1);
$cartService->addItem($sneakers, 1);

## How Buy X Get Y Free Works

### Configuration
```php
'conditions' => [
    'buy_quantity' => 2,           // Customer must buy 2 items
    'get_quantity' => 1,           // Customer gets 1 free
    'apply_to_cheapest' => true,   // Free item is the cheapest
    'eligible_product_ids' => [],  // Specific products (empty = all)
    'eligible_category_ids' => [2] // Specific categories
]
```

### Logic Flow
1. **Filter Eligible Items**: Check cart items against eligible products/categories
2. **Calculate Qualification**: Total eligible quantity Ã· buy_quantity = sets qualified
3. **Calculate Free Items**: Sets qualified Ã— get_quantity = total free items
4. **Sort Items**: By price (cheapest first if apply_to_cheapest = true)
5. **Apply Discount**: Mark cheapest items as free, apply 100% discount
6. **Return Result**: Discount amount, affected items, free items list

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Buy 2 Get 1 Free (Clothing)
- Cart: T-Shirt ($19.99), Jeans ($49.99), Sneakers ($79.99)
- Result: T-Shirt is free, pay $129.98

#### Scenario 2: Buy 3 Get 2 Free (All Products)
- Cart: 5 items ranging from $12.99 to $79.99
- Result: 2 cheapest items free (1 set qualified)

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Sets
- Cart: 6 clothing items
- Result: 3 items free (3 sets qualified for Buy 2 Get 1)
